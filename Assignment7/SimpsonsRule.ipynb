    "The trapeziodal rule approximates the area under a curve by approximating the curve with straight line segments. We can often get a much better result if we approximate the function instead with a curve of some kind. Simpson's rule does exactly this, using quadratic curves. In order to specify a quadratic completely, you need three points, not just two as with a straight line. So in this method, we take a pair of adjacent slices and fit a quadratic through the three points that mark the boundaries of those slices. Simpson's rule involves approximating the integrand with quadratics this way, then calculating the area under those quadratics, which gives an approximation to the area under the true curve."
